## Why AI-specific cover matters

Deploying AI in a regulated sector creates liability surfaces that ordinary
technology cover does not reach: inference liability, audit-trail liability,
data-breach liability and IP-infringement liability.

## How this project's architecture reduces insurable risk

| Risk | Cloud AI | PSENSOR with AIOSS |
|---|---|---|
| Audit-trail loss | high — vendor-controlled logs | low — append-only chain, verifiable offline |
| Data breach in transit | high — data transits external servers | low — no external endpoint |
| Compliance violation | high — cannot satisfy air-gap requirements | low — structural |
| IP liability | moderate | low — pinned provenance chain |
